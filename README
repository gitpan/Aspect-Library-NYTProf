NAME
    Aspect::Library::NYTProf - Allows pointcut-targetted NYTProf profiling

SYNOPSIS
      # Only profile code that runs in constructors
      use Aspect;
      aspect NYTProf => call qr/::new$/;
      
  # Using this profile pattern from the command line
      NYTPROF=start=no perl -d:NYTProf script.pl

DESCRIPTION
    Aspect::Library::NYTProf provides a pre-built Aspect library for doing
    Devel::NYTProf profiling on a targetted subset of your application.

    This is implemented using the built-in "DB::enable_profile()" and
    "DB::disable_profile()" functions you might normally use with
    Devel::NYTProf, but allows for targetting the profiling using the full
    range of pointcuts available in Aspect.

    For example, the following allows profiling of "Foo::bar()", but only
    when called in scalar context.

      aspect NYTProf => call 'Foo::bar' & wantscalar;
